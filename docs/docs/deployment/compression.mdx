# HTTP Compression

The Hasura GraphQL Engine supports HTTP compression. The server looks
for the `Accept-Encoding` header in request. The server chooses either
[brotli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli) 
or [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) based on Accept-Encoding
client header. If both are requested then the server picks brotli. 
Also, the server sets the `Content-Encoding` response header value 
based on the requested `Accept-Encoding`.

**Only responses from "/v2/query" and "/v1/graphql" endpoints are
compressed.**
